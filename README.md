Hi👋
Welcome to my repo.

It is a movie recommendation site.
Where one selects a movie from a dataset of about 7000 movies.
They then get a recommedation of 5 movies based on their selection.

# Structure 🐾

The repo is divided into 4 modules:
- Data pulling ; Kaggle_data.py
- Movie recommedation ; Movie_filter.py
- UI ; Main.py
- Run ; Fin.py
